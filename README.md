# Nest Trello Application
This is the README for the Nest.js-based Trello application. This application allows you to interact with Trello boards and manage tasks within them. It provides API endpoints to fetch tasks from a Trello board, save them to a local database, and retrieve saved tasks. Additionally, there is an HTML interface provided to view and refresh the saved tasks.
